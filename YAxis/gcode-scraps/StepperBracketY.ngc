%(This makes you a stepper motor mounting bracket for the Y axis)
%(Set 0,0 to bottom LEFT corner of aluminium barstock)
%This assumes the block has been milled to the appropriate dimensions
%and the gcode is intended to cut the stepper holes and drill the 
%stepper bolt holes.
%it's intended for manual X (as I haven't converted X on my machine yet)

%I found I needed a slightly larger mounting lip clearance to fit comfortably
%so made another pass:

%(machine the stepper clearance hole)
%(Clearance hole radius is 15mm)
